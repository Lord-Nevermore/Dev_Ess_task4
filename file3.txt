Divine Rapier
The Divine Rapier is an item listed at the Main Shop, under Weapons. However, it is assembled entirely with items from the Secret Shop.

Trivia
Divine Rapier's item icon used to have a little bit of animations. The light rays coming from the top right would slowly move across the icon, and yellow sparkle effects appearead on the rapier. This animation was removed in the patch for unknown reasons.
